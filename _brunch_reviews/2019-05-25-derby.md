This week, RCR had brunch at [Derby][derbweb], a upscale restaurant and part of
a car club in SODO.

This week's route was absolutely incredible and while the forecast showed rain,
we got none of it during the run.  We started in the industrial district of
Seattle and went over the West Seattle bridge to hit the Alki trail.  More than
half of the run was along the gorgeous Puget Sound. After touching the tip of
Alki, we ran south to make a big loop around West Seattle and finally got back
to the industrial district to get 15 miles.

Derby is one of the few brunch options in Seattle's industrial district. It is
part of a country club for car enthusiasts and even provides a viewing area for
customers to look at fancy cars! While interior adds an upscale, club-like feel
to the restaurant there is also a lounging area with big and cozy couches.

We ordered hash bowls (both veggie and beef), biscuit sandwiches, and coffee
all of which was delicious.  While meat-eaters will have no problem finding
their perfect comfort food at Derby, vegetarians/vegans may be forced to settle
for the veggie hash.

We will certainly consider Derby in the future, especially if we end a run in SODO.
It has the RCR stamp of approval.

### Verdict

Food: 2 veggie options out of 5
Drink: 5 cups of coffee out of 5
Wait time: 1 minute (just to set up our table)
Chill Factor: 5 sweaty runners out of 5
