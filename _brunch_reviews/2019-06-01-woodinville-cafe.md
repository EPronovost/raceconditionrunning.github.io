Chooo chooooooooo!

Welcome to the [Woodinville Cafe][woodinville-cafe-web].
It's like Denny's but not a national chain.
The portions are huge, but after 16 miles everyone cleared their plates.

The interior is decorated in charming train themes.  Old railway signs and
advertisements and luggage racks (complete with actual luggage!) adorn the
walls.  The great mystery is: Who's luggage is this? What's inside of it?  Some
say the luggage is just purchased from SeaTac, the stuff that no one claimed
after a few weeks of the poor bags slowly and sadly circling the luggage
conveyor. If that's true, then this luggage may the luckiest to have ever been
abandoned.  In its new life, a suitcase or duffel bag now sits high on the
wall, surveying the joy and happiness and bustle of a vibrant diner ecosystem.
No longer does it need to slave for ungrateful travelers who barely notice its
existence, indeed who had completely forgotten and abandoned it.  Instead each
day is filled with smiles and laughter bubbling up from customers and the
friendly chit chat from servers and hosts as they take care of their patrons
with a smile and prompt service.

This was our first time up in Woodinville, so we asked the locals what they
thought of the place.

Susan Suitcase (a blue 40 year veteran of the luggage racks with smart chrome
finish) felt that the Woodinville Cafe is experiencing a golden age in omelets:

>   Look kids, I've been here a while and what you may not appreciate is the
>   level of fluff that this joint has been able to pull off.  You go to any
>   other diner in this neck of the woods and you aren't going to get this kind
>   of fluffy omelet.  Don't get me wrong, even the Denny's down the street and
>   get a couple of light air bubbles, but this establishment is really taking
>   things to the next level.  I heard that last week in some new experiments
>   they actually had an omelet that was so light, it FLOATED.  Seriously,
>   floating omelets!  The kitchen went berserk.  It was like trying to eat on
>   the International Space Station or something.  Eggs everywhere.  I mean, I
>   love light fluffy eggs, but things may be getting out of hand here.  As our
>   technological progress accelerates, it's important that our reach not
>   exceed our grasp!

Derek Duffle (a brown, heavy canvas fellow from the Nixon era) seemed disturbed
by Susan's account and tried to provide some more context:

>   Susan has been here a long time and seen some shit.  You have to appreciate
>   that a diner is a busy place, lots going on, all sorts of folks coming in
>   and out at all hours.  I mean, we love Susan, but she's coming unhinged.
>   Literally.  Like, they had to bring in the luggage repair guy and he ordered
>   new hinges for her.  I think we'll stop hearing about all this space station
>   stuff once she's back from the doc.  At least, I hope so or they'll have
>   to retire her to the Value Village on the other side of the parking lot...

Logan, a rising star on the host staff, reassured us that the luggage, while
quite friendly, was not actually sentient and that delirium and dehydration
due to running 16 summer miles were more likely explanations for our experience.
He got us our food promptly and courteously, checking in frequently to make
sure everyone at the table was all right.
